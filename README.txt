Recipe Hero BigOven integrates your recipes with BigOven, allowing users to save recipes and their ingredients to their BigOven accounts

== Description ==

This plugin integrates your site with [BigOven](http://bigoven.com/) so you can add a 'Save Recipe to BigOven' button.

You can use the Recipe Hero BigOven settings to automatically add it to the top of your recipes. Additionally, it comes with a `[rhbigoven]` shortcode that will add a save button anywhere too.

**Known issue:**  In our first release, if you have a URL with multiple Recipe Hero recipes, only the first one will be chosen.  We'll be addressing this with BigOven in the near future, either letting the user pick from among the multiple recipes or specifically identifying the recipe which the user chose. So for now, the automatic addition of the save button will only be on single recipes, and we recommend only using the shortcode on single recipes.
